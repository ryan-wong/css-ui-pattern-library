Styled Select Box
=======================

Styled Select box is a simple trick to hide the css of the select box and show a div on top.

The trick is to set the appearance css for the selectbox to none and use the style of the div around it to colour it.

To put a new arrow on the right hand side, change the background image to the new arrow and push it to the right to overlap the select box one.
