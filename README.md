CSS UI Pattern Library
======================

This repository will hold all code needed to make a css UI element from scratch with explanation as to how it works. 

In each repository, there will be:
- a HTML file showing the html code with the css code right before it
- sass mixin for that ui
- any javascript required
- README file explaing how the ui works

All UI components will be wrapped to work out off the shelve for easy usage.
