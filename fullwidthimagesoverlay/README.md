Full Width Image With Overlaying Text
===================================================
Ever need an image to be full width of page and and have text centered in middle?

This mixin helps you obtain that effect.

It works by first forcing the image to be maximum size inside a position relative div.

Then have a position absolute div inside that fills it completely and put your text there.

Scale the positioning with percentages.
